# scully-blastoise

A boilerplate / starter that provides for react, typescript, and does not limit to working solely with that ecosystem.
You can develop single page and multi-page applications.

However, there's a limit to how much I've managed to automate. You'll find yourself having to hand-wire things now and then.

Feel free to use as you wish
